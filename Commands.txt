Git Merging
=================
Merging of a branch always happens based on the time stamp of the commits.

Not a latest version

a -> b->c ->D ->E
master: a,b,E
Child:C,D (latest code)

Git Rebasing
==================
This is also called fast forward merge and here the commits coming from a branch will projected as the top most commits on the master branch.

a -> b ->E ->c ->D
master: a,b,E
Child:C,D (latest)
